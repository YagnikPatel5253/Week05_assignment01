    "Exception in Python:\n",
    "An exception in Python is an event or occurrence that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exceptional situation arises, such as an error or an unexpected condition, Python raises an exception. Exceptions are used to handle errors, allowing the program to gracefully respond to unexpected situations and prevent the application from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are represented by classes, and they can be raised explicitly by the raise statement or raised implicitly by the interpreter when an error occurs. Exception handling in Python involves using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage the flow of the program and handle exceptions appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program. They represent runtime errors or unexpected conditions that are encountered while the program is running.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur during the parsing of the code. They are typically due to violations of the Python syntax rules and prevent the program from being successfully interpreted or compiled.\n",
    "Detection Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions are detected at runtime, meaning they are only discovered when the affected code is executed.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected during the parsing or compilation phase, before the code is executed. If there are syntax errors, the interpreter/compiler halts and does not proceed to the execution phase.\n",
    "Handling Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try, except, else, and finally blocks, allowing the program to respond to errors and continue executing or perform cleanup actions.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be successfully executed. They are typically resolved by correcting the syntax mistakes in the source code.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, and FileNotFoundError. These errors occur during the execution of the program based on the input or the runtime environment.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Examples of syntax errors include missing colons at the end of statements, mismatched parentheses, or invalid indentation. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase."
